Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(infra): Add .gitignore and fix dependencies

Infrastructure improvements for professional project hygiene. Created comprehensive
.gitignore covering Python artifacts (__pycache__, *.pyc, virtual environments, IDE
files), generated output files (frames/, calendar.png, extended_data.csv,
master_calendar.csv), and common development artifacts. Fixed missing click dependency
in requirements.txt that was imported by main.py but not listed.

Proper .gitignore configuration prevents committing generated files, build artifacts, and
local development files to version control. This keeps the repository clean and focused
on source code. The missing dependency would have caused import errors for new users
trying to run the application - fixing this ensures proper dependency specification.

These infrastructure improvements are essential for portfolio quality, demonstrating
understanding of project organization, dependency management, and version control best
practices.
