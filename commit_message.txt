Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(api): Add Flask web server with entry endpoint

Implemented basic Flask web application providing API capability for programmatic calendar
entry submission. Created app.py with a POST endpoint at /entry to receive calendar event
data in JSON format. Server configured to run on port 5000 with debug mode enabled for
development. Added flask dependency to requirements.txt.

This early addition of web API capability allows future integration with external systems
and provides a programmatic interface for event submission beyond manual CSV editing.
The decision to include API functionality from the start reflects anticipation of broader
use cases beyond local script execution.
