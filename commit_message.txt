Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(viz): Add basic calendar visualization with matplotlib

Implemented initial visual calendar generation using matplotlib for high-quality PNG output.
Created draw_calendar function establishing the rendering pipeline with figure and axis
setup. Basic time-blocked schedule display showing events positioned by date and time.
Added matplotlib and click dependencies to requirements.txt.

Visual representation is essential for practical weekly planning - numerical data alone is
insufficient for quick schedule comprehension. Matplotlib was chosen for its flexibility
and ability to generate publication-quality graphics. The time-blocked layout provides
intuitive visualization where event blocks are proportional to duration and positioned
by start time.

This establishes the foundation of the visualization engine, with basic plotting structure
that subsequent commits will enhance with color-coding, auto-sizing text, and other
visual improvements.
