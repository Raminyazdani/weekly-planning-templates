Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(portfolio): Add project identity and portfolio documentation

Final portfolio readiness commit creating comprehensive metadata and documentation for
the portfolio transformation process. Added project_identity.md with professional naming
(Weekly Calendar Planner), tagline, detailed description, complete tech stack, problem/
approach documentation, and topics/keywords for discoverability. Created report.md
documenting the entire portfolio transformation process, suggestion.txt tracking all
identified issues, and suggestions_done.txt recording all applied changes with before/
after details.

This commit establishes clear project branding suitable for portfolio presentation and
provides complete documentation of the refinement process. The project identity document
defines how the project should be presented professionally, while the tracking documents
provide transparency into the improvements made during portfolio preparation.

Updated .github/ infrastructure to reflect current project state. This represents the
final step bringing the project to production-ready, portfolio-quality state with all
necessary metadata, documentation, and process tracking in place.
