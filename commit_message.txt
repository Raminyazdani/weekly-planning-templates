Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(events): Add recurring event expansion logic

Implemented the core feature for handling recurring events across extended date ranges.
Added extend_original_df function that expands events marked as weekly, bi-weekly, daily,
or one-time across their specified date ranges, creating individual event instances for
each occurrence. Added aggregate_mc_df function to link expanded events to master calendar
dates.

This functionality allows users to define recurring events once (e.g., "Weekly tutorial
on Tuesdays") and have them automatically expanded across an entire semester or year.
Supports multiple recurrence patterns: daily (every day), weekly (same weekday each week),
bi-weekly (alternating weeks), and one-time (single occurrence). This eliminates tedious
manual entry of repetitive events.

The event expansion logic is central to the application's value proposition, transforming
concise CSV definitions into complete, detailed schedules spanning extended periods.
