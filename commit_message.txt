Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(frames): Add 7-day sliding window frame generation

Added weekly frame generation feature creating multiple 7-day sliding window visualizations.
Users can now browse through extended schedules (e.g., entire semester) week by week.
Initial implementation processes frames sequentially. Created frames/ output directory for
storing individual weekly PNG files.

For long date ranges (e.g., 6-month semester), a single calendar visualization becomes
impractically large and hard to read. The sliding window approach generates a series of
weekly views that users can navigate through, similar to flipping pages in a physical
planner. Each frame shows exactly 7 days, providing optimal readability.

Sequential processing was chosen initially to verify correctness and proper frame
generation logic before optimization. This commit focuses on establishing the frame
generation feature, with performance optimization to follow in the next commit.
