Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(portfolio): Rename temp.csv to events.csv

Portfolio refinement renaming temp.csv to events.csv for more descriptive, professional
naming. Updated file reference in main.py (line 472) to match the new filename.

The name "temp" suggests temporary or test data, which is inappropriate for a production
application. "events.csv" clearly describes the file's purpose and presents more
professionally. This is important for portfolio presentation where file naming contributes
to perceived code quality.

This type of naming improvement is common when transitioning from rapid prototyping to
production-ready code. Clear, descriptive names improve code comprehension and demonstrate
attention to detail.
