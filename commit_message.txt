Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(api): Fix typo in Flask endpoint path

Hotfix correcting Flask route decorator typo from /entrey to /entry. Bug was discovered
during manual API testing when POST requests to /entry returned 404 errors. Code review
revealed the typo in the decorator.

This type of typo is common during rapid development and typically caught during the first
manual test of the endpoint. The fix is immediate and straightforward - a single character
change that resolves the routing issue completely. This represents realistic iterative
development where small mistakes are caught and fixed quickly during testing.
