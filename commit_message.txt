Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(viz): Add automatic font sizing for event text

Implemented auto-sizing text rendering for event names within calendar blocks. Event text
automatically scales down to fit within time blocks, handling variable-length event names
gracefully. Added font fitting functions that calculate maximum font size based on
available space while preventing text overflow.

Event names vary significantly in length (from short acronyms to long descriptive titles).
Without auto-sizing, either short names would be unnecessarily small or long names would
overflow their blocks. The auto-sizing algorithm maximizes font size for better visibility
while ensuring all text fits cleanly within its allocated space.

This enhancement improves both aesthetics and practicality - every event is clearly
labeled regardless of name length, and the calendar maintains professional appearance
without manual font size adjustments.
