Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(calendar): Add German holiday integration to master calendar

Enhanced master calendar with German public holiday support using the workalendar library.
Added Germany calendar object, holiday detection logic, and IsOffDay flag that combines
both weekends and holidays into a unified indicator for non-working days. Holiday names
and dates are now integrated into the master calendar dataframe.

Holiday integration is essential for realistic schedule planning, particularly for
academic or professional schedules. The choice of German holidays reflects the developer's
location and target use case. The unified IsOffDay flag simplifies downstream logic by
providing a single boolean indicator for all types of non-working days.

Added workalendar to requirements.txt to support comprehensive holiday calculations
across different years and regions.
