Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | WIP(docs): Add comprehensive README structure and sections

First phase of major README expansion establishing portfolio-grade documentation structure.
Added sections for project description, tech stack, repository structure, setup
instructions, usage examples, input/output documentation, customization guide, and
troubleshooting. Created section headers and table of contents preparing for detailed
content in the next commit.

This commit focuses on establishing the documentation framework - the skeleton that will
be filled with detailed content. Separating structure creation from content writing allows
focused work on documentation organization before diving into specific details. This
two-phase approach (structure first, then content) is common for large documentation
efforts.

Portfolio-grade documentation requires comprehensive coverage of all aspects users need
to understand, install, and use the application. This structure ensures no important
topics are overlooked.
