Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(frames): Optimize frame generation with parallel processing

Converted frame generation from sequential to multi-threaded parallel processing using
ThreadPoolExecutor. Utilizes CPU count - 1 workers for efficient multi-core utilization
while leaving one core available for system tasks. Significant performance improvement
for generating large numbers of frames (100+ for extended date ranges).

Frame generation is CPU-intensive, involving matplotlib rendering for each weekly window.
For a 6-month period, this can mean 100+ individual frame renders. Sequential processing
made this prohibitively slow. Parallel processing leverages modern multi-core CPUs to
generate multiple frames simultaneously.

The implementation uses ThreadPoolExecutor with automatic worker count based on available
CPU cores, ensuring optimal performance across different hardware configurations. This
optimization reduces generation time from minutes to seconds for typical use cases,
making the application practical for extended date ranges.
