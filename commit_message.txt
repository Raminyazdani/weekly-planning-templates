Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | WIP(data): Add event data structure and sample CSV files

Defined the event data model using CSV format for simplicity and human readability. Created
sample data files (data.csv) demonstrating various event types and recurrence patterns.
Added new_main.py containing documentation of the expected data format with column
descriptions and example values. Included pandas dependency for data processing.

WARNING: This commit contains a bug - the Flask endpoint route decorator has a typo
(/entrey instead of /entry) that will cause 404 errors when testing the API endpoint.
This will be discovered and fixed in the next commit during manual API testing.

The CSV-based approach provides a simple, widely-compatible data format that users can
edit with any text editor or spreadsheet application. Sample data demonstrates the
flexibility of the event system with different recurrence patterns (daily, weekly,
bi-weekly, one-time events).
