Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(viz): Add color coding by event group with persistent colors

Enhanced calendar visualization with automatic color-coding based on event groups. Each
group is assigned a unique color generated from a hash of the group name. Implemented
color dictionary persistence to maintain consistent colors across multiple runs, ensuring
the same group always receives the same color.

Color-coding dramatically improves calendar readability by allowing visual distinction
between different event categories (e.g., lectures, personal time, work commitments).
Color persistence provides consistent user experience - users learn to associate specific
colors with specific groups, making schedule comprehension faster with repeated use.

The hash-based color generation ensures automatic assignment without requiring manual
color configuration, while the persistence mechanism (storing colors to a file/dict)
prevents color reassignment between runs.
