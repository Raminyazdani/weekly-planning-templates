Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(portfolio): Remove academic prefixes from event types

Portfolio refinement removing "uni-" prefixes from event types to make the application
more generic and professional. Changed uni-lecture → lecture, uni-tutorial → tutorial,
uni-assignment → assignment, uni-exam → exam, uni-lab → lab throughout all data files
(events.csv, data.csv, extended_data.csv), HTML form options, and documentation.

The academic "uni-" prefix limited the application's perceived applicability to university
contexts only. Generic event types make the tool applicable to any scheduling scenario
(professional, personal, mixed) and present more professionally in a portfolio context.
This change demonstrates thinking beyond the initial use case to create a more versatile
tool.

Updated all data files to reflect the new naming convention, ensuring consistency across
the entire application. Also fixed any remaining typos discovered during this comprehensive
review of event type usage.
