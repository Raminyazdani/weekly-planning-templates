Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(docs): Add detailed README content and examples

Completed comprehensive README documentation filling all sections with detailed content.
Added thorough descriptions of project functionality, complete tech stack explanation,
detailed setup instructions, data format tables with column descriptions, usage examples,
output file documentation, customization guide, and troubleshooting section. Removed
outdated directory references that no longer match current structure.

This represents the content phase of README improvement, building on the structure
established in the previous commit. Every section now contains practical, detailed
information that enables users to fully understand and use the application. Includes
data format tables showing CSV structure, code examples for different use cases, and
solutions for common issues.

Portfolio-quality documentation should be accessible to potential employers or
collaborators, providing all information needed to understand the project's value,
technical implementation, and practical usage. Clear troubleshooting helps users resolve
issues independently, reducing support burden.
