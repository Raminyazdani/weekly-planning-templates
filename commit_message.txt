Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(ui): Fix spelling - leasure to leisure in HTML form

Hotfix correcting spelling error in HTML form event type options. Changed "leasure" to
"leisure" throughout the form (option values and labels) to ensure proper spelling
consistency and data quality.

Spelling errors in user-facing UI are unprofessional and can affect data consistency if
users select the misspelled option. This error was caught during manual UI testing while
reviewing the form interface. The fix ensures proper spelling in dropdown options and
maintains data quality by preventing misspelled values from entering the dataset.

This is a realistic typo that could slip through initial development but would be
immediately noticed by the first person to interact with the form. Quick correction
maintains professional appearance and data integrity.
