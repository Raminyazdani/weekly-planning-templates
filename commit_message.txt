Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(dev): Add testing and development utilities

Added utility scripts for development, testing, and validation. Created test.py for date
iteration testing, testing.py for data processing utilities (especially bi-weekly
recurrence logic), and dayereh.txt containing sample numeric data for validation purposes.

These utilities support the development process by providing dedicated tools for testing
specific components in isolation. The bi-weekly recurrence calculation is particularly
tricky (accounting for alternating weeks), so having a standalone utility for verification
helps ensure correctness. These scripts remain separate from the main application to keep
the core codebase clean and focused.

Development utilities like these are common in real projects - they represent the informal
tooling developers create to verify logic, debug issues, and validate edge cases during
implementation. They provide value during development without cluttering the production
code.
