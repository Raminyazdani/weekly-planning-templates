Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | WIP(ui): Add HTML form for manual event entry

Created user-friendly HTML form interface for manual event data entry. Form includes
dropdowns for event types and days, date pickers for date ranges, time inputs, and
checkboxes for recurrence patterns. Supports all event fields with appropriate input types
and includes basic JavaScript validation.

WARNING: This commit contains a spelling error - the event type dropdown includes "leasure"
instead of "leisure" in multiple locations. This typo will be noticed during UI testing
and corrected in the next commit.

The form provides a more accessible interface for users uncomfortable with direct CSV
editing. Particularly useful for quick event additions or modifications without opening
spreadsheet applications. The form validates required fields and enforces proper data
formats, reducing user errors compared to manual CSV editing.

This represents an alternative input method complementing the CSV workflow, catering to
different user preferences and use cases.
