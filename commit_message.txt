Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(calendar): Implement master calendar date range generation

Built the foundation for calendar operations by implementing core date range generation
logic. Added functions in main.py for loading CSV data, converting column types (dates,
times, booleans), and creating the master calendar dataframe spanning user-specified date
ranges. Implemented weekend detection to identify non-working days.

The master calendar serves as the backbone for all subsequent event mapping and
visualization operations. By creating a comprehensive date range upfront, the system can
efficiently map events to specific dates and handle recurring patterns. Weekend detection
prepares for future holiday integration to identify all non-working days.

This represents the first major piece of business logic, establishing the data structures
and operations that all other features will build upon.
