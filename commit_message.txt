Ramin Yazdani | Weekly Calendar Planner | main | feat(init): Initial repository setup with README and gitignore

Project initialization establishing the foundation for a weekly calendar planner application.
Created basic repository structure with Python .gitignore patterns to exclude common Python
development artifacts (pycache, virtual environments, IDE files). Added initial README.md
outlining the project concept and empty requirements.txt placeholder for future dependencies.

This represents a standard first commit for any Python project, establishing the repository
structure and documentation foundation before implementing any actual functionality.
